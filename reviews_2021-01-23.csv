hs305,1,86.0,The colour is amontillad and the texture shows a few slow late legs and late fat tears. The nose is all about a honey-sweet sherry profile with some vanilla-driven aromas. Just as you would expect from the two casks it matured in. I like it when marketing and reality fit together...,"The taste is on honey, vanilla -toffee and some sherry-induced flavours like dark chocolate and raisins. Not the slightest trace of sulphur, so congrats to an excellent cask management at Balvenie. The wood is still a little heavy and bitter but not as extreme as with the first mouthfeel. It is bearable now and after a while even enjoyable.","The dram arrives in the mouth gentle and smooth but with some astringent feelings from heavy tannins that I do not like. Another victim to the cask shortage crisis (some virgin oak in there)? Not too sure about that but it feels this way. The finish is of medium length and gets more chocolatey, really nice. Just a slight dryness from the wood (not unpleasant here).",88,81,85
DulischM,1,76.0,"At the beginning the whisky is sweet on the nose and characterized by vanilla, which changes into aromas of spring-like light honey. At the end there is some nutty, malty sweetness.","In the mouth it is light and pleasantly sweet, vanilla and honey are great in harmony and there is a hint of sherry under everything. The malt sweetness passes over to the aroma of young, but dry wood after a long time.","The finish is sweet with a little honey, malt sweetness remains on the palate. When the whisky has already left the palate, a tiny bit of fresh grass and wood aroma emerges.",,,

Punktar,1,85.0,"Yellow fruits, some sherry and honey. Anyway, in the first nose. After that comes more honey. And some vanilla? Smells very intense and how a good Speysider should smell. For those who liked the old Founders Reserve, it took a bit of getting used to. But I like it so far.","Hmm, soft, fruity and vanilla. Just another sip ... Now with some honey and something like cinnamon in the background? Just another sip! Clearly yellow fruits (and mandarin?) And vanilla. A little bit of alcohol, but that does not really bother. Delicious! One more ... No, I just want to try.","Pretty long and pleasant. Long-lasting fruity tangerine, now more pronounced than before.",,,

hs305,23,87.0,"The colour of OLD is two shades darker at old gold than NEW which is at jonquiripe corn (despite they used caramel on NEW). The nose of OLD offers a balanced sweet-peaty pofile with honeys, ripe yellow fruits, barley sugars and maritime-peaty aromas. The smoke grows stronger upon breathing without harming the balance as additional waxy and autumn floral notes join in as well. A pretty fine nose for a 12-years old, indeed1 NEW offers a quite different profile with shy unripe green fruits, more sugars and a different smokey impression (no maritime notes, rather like a cold bonfire). It is balanced too with more wood impact, but much simplier than OLD. I clearly prefer the nose from 2002.","The taste of OLD is quite bold on delicious sweet flavours over fine peat smoke notes. The fruits are present all the time as are the barley sugars, later some waxes and meaty notes (smoked bacon) join in. It is not very complex but it is a tasty mix, easy to quaff. NEW's taste is much more wood-driven with sweet barley sugars balancing the bitter tannins nicely. It is easy drinkble too but a complete different style. Again I prefer OLD clearly.","OLD arrives warming and instantly coating on the palate without distracting moments. The initial mouthfeel of NEW is warming and coating too but a little less impressive with a minor bitter-astringent moment (tannins at work). Both drams own a long finish where OLD adds some spices and herbal impressions without distracting moments at all. NEW turns more bitter during the finish with a drying mouthfeel, now the tannins of the wood take control and drive NEW out of balance, unfortunately. Water is not needed on both.",87,87,88

hs305,122,91.0,"Colour is irrelevant as Diageo usually uses caramel to fix it - but for the records: The 20y is at old gold, the 25y is at old gold and the 35y is one shade paler at jonquiripe corn. The texture of the 20y shows a fat sticky ring at the top of the glass that very, very slowly transforms into fat sticky tears and extremely slow legs (great oiliness!), the 25y shows many small sticky tears first that slowly consolidate and form slow legs (another good oiliness) and the 35y shows early bigger tears and slightly faster legs as well as late fat sticky tears (not too bad either). The nose of the 20y offers a complex profile of grassy, herbal, spicy and slightly peaty aromas with hints of salt all nicely balanced. The 25y has a comparable profile with stronger herbal and less peaty aromas and is a little unbalanced compared to the 20y. The nosing profile of the 35y is again grassy-herbal and is much stronger than the other two with no peaty aromas at all (but again hints of salt and other spices). I like the 20y best followed by the 35y and the 25y.","A truly multi-layered barley-sweet, peaty and herbal flavours profile is unveiled by the 20y that later adds spices, salt and hints of ripe fruits to the party, really delicious. The 25y shows more wooden and less peaty flavours than the 20y and no salt at all. The 35y owns a more complex flavours profile on the palate (of course) with sugary, herbal, spicy and hints of peaty aromas. It is nicely layered and one to investigate for hours (if you have enough time and whisky). On this dimension I prefer the 35y over the 20y followed by the 25y. Some water opens the nose of the 20y very nicely and adds significant more (sweeter) aromas, I like it that way better. But do not add too much as the dram turns flat quite quickly. The reduced 25y gets smoother both in the nose and on the palate but does not add many new aromas, again I like it better a little reduced. Adding some water reveils more aromas with the 35y both in the nose and on the palate (especially some delicious peaty flavours).","The 20y instantly coats the whole of the mouth with a nice warming feeling and just minor peppery moments (despite 58,8% abv) - the great texture kept its promise. The 25y arrives less coating and somewhat hotter on the palate (56,9% abv) with no bitter or astringent moments either. The mouthfeel of the 35y is again less coating than the 20y and slightly bitter (tannins, no wonder after 35 years in the cask). The 20y owns a very long finish (what else, given the great texture) that sticks to the palate even minutes after I swallowed the dram. It nicely vanishes in waves and has no bitter nor drying nor astringent moments, just great! The finish of the 25y is significantly shorter with more sweeter and less herbal flavours than the taste and again no distracting feelings. The 35y has a longer finish than the 25y but shorter than the 20y that vanishes in waves again but shows some minor bitter wooden notes (that are not unpleasant at all).

With water it becomes just about perfect, and gives out some hints of bourbon.","Neat it's too sharp for me, but despite the alcohol cutting into my tongue, the body already feels perfect: Full - luxuriously so - and rich with a strong peaty backbone on which everything else rests. Perfect oak, pepperiness, turfy peat, and salmiak with a side of seawater. The peat is immense. It's a little harsh but it works very well, and is actually very impressive in its imposing, relentless attack. I get some flashbacks to various batches of Laphroaig 25, but I much prefer this Talisker to any of those.","A long, sinking peat wave followed by tannins and wet plaster. Lasts a good while.

hs305,123,89.0,"Colour is irrelevant as Diageo usually uses caramel to fix it - but for the records: The 20y is at old gold, the 25y is at old gold and the 35y is one shade paler at jonquiripe corn. The texture of the 20y shows a fat sticky ring at the top of the glass that very, very slowly transforms into fat sticky tears and extremely slow legs (great oiliness!), the 25y shows many small sticky tears first that slowly consolidate and form slow legs (another good oiliness) and the 35y shows early bigger tears and slightly faster legs as well as late fat sticky tears (not too bad either). The nose of the 20y offers a complex profile of grassy, herbal, spicy and slightly peaty aromas with hints of salt all nicely balanced. The 25y has a comparable profile with stronger herbal and less peaty aromas and is a little unbalanced compared to the 20y. The nosing profile of the 35y is again grassy-herbal and is much stronger than the other two with no peaty aromas at all (but again hints of salt and other spices). I like the 20y best followed by the 35y and the 25y.","A truly multi-layered barley-sweet, peaty and herbal flavours profile is unveiled by the 20y that later adds spices, salt and hints of ripe fruits to the party, really delicious. The 25y shows more wooden and less peaty flavours than the 20y and no salt at all. The 35y owns a more complex flavours profile on the palate (of course) with sugary, herbal, spicy and hints of peaty aromas. It is nicely layered and one to investigate for hours (if you have enough time and whisky). On this dimension I prefer the 35y over the 20y followed by the 25y. Some water opens the nose of the 20y very nicely and adds significant more (sweeter) aromas, I like it that way better. But do not add too much as the dram turns flat quite quickly. The reduced 25y gets smoother both in the nose and on the palate but does not add many new aromas, again I like it better a little reduced. Adding some water reveils more aromas with the 35y both in the nose and on the palate (especially some delicious peaty flavours).","The 20y instantly coats the whole of the mouth with a nice warming feeling and just minor peppery moments (despite 58,8% abv) - the great texture kept its promise. The 25y arrives less coating and somewhat hotter on the palate (56,9% abv) with no bitter or astringent moments either. The mouthfeel of the 35y is again less coating than the 20y and slightly bitter (tannins, no wonder after 35 years in the cask). The 20y owns a very long finish (what else, given the great texture) that sticks to the palate even minutes after I swallowed the dram. It nicely vanishes in waves and has no bitter nor drying nor astringent moments, just great! The finish of the 25y is significantly shorter with more sweeter and less herbal flavours than the taste and again no distracting feelings. The 35y has a longer finish than the 25y but shorter than the 20y that vanishes in waves again but shows some minor bitter wooden notes (that are not unpleasant at all). It adds some sweeter flavours too that are very welcomed.",88,89,89

Elegant Sherrynoten are present immediately. Ripe, red fruits, nuts, almonds, caramel, dark forest honey and chocolate follow. The initially juicy oranges turn into grapefruit, which are slightly acidic. Christmas spices and old oak notes are always present, but never too intrusive or dominant.

The 1966 offers a rich, almost bold nose on fruity and floral aromas together with a nice honey driven sweetness, very complex and balanced. Due to its high abv of 53.6% the 1977 needs some time of breathing before releasing a more winey and slightly cheesy profile. With water it opens up further, of course and shows more aromas of a sweet wine. This round clearly goes to the older vintage.","The 1966 vintage has a very complex yet well balanced profile of barley sugary, slightly woody and floral/grassy flavours. The Rare Malt is more on the fruity (oranges, lime) and herbal side imbedded in a sound sweet and wooden structure. With water it gets smoother but a little thinner too Hard to judge on this, but I see a slight advantage for the 1966 again (due to its greater complexity).","Bold and instantly mouth-coating with the 1966 - fat, oily and coating too with the 1977. Both are very good at the first sip and I vote for a draw. Both own a very long finish with the 1966 slightly drying out at the very end, but not too unpleasantly.

In addition, every now and then a second note of wood flashes on the damp areas in the basement or after a rain in the forest on fallen trees are decomposed by fungi - old rotten damp wood with a touch Camembert (tree fungus) - but so decent and pleasant that it is enriching for me and not disturbing - this comes a potpourri of red fruits, very creamy and homogeneous - complex interwoven and difficult to break down, ripe sweet black cherries, raspberry puree, red and black currants - crushed both fruit acidity and the bitter substances of Kernels and peels are clearly perceptible, cultivated blueberries, plus a light cinnamon note, some nutmeg, clove and geranium leaves (flower). Fruits and oak alternate - are alternately in the foreground and no one has the upper hand - always full of vanilla and in the background fresh mint with a resinous-oaky-ethereal-oily fragrance, strong spicy tobacco leaves - freshly cut, and increasingly present more orange oil.  With more time in the glass and careful ""vorbeiriechen"" on known - flower nectar, tender but present.  After the first sip, especially the leather notes in the nose increase positively, thus it looks a little less elegant - but the more mature.","astringent oak leaves the mouth dry immediately, grape seeds, green banana peel, fresh olives from the tree, unripe khaki-rich broadside tannins - I did not have that yet. In addition, red berries - rather acidic with subtle sweetness and light bitter substances, chocolate, cocoa, coffee - at the same time minty fresh, a little peppery, to a delicate tart spicy vegetable sharpness like of rosemary and ginger.  With the second sip it becomes sweeter, the fruits darken - voluminous, creamier and displace the tannins for the most part, it now appears more complex and fruity - in the background a board of spice.","yes what is taste and what finish - at 40% and the strong flow of saliva through the tannins that's hard to say, you do not want to swallow too soon: the finish is not particularly long but the spicy tannins remain very long on the tongue - for minutes , While the red fruits fade first, a slightly musty leather and tobacco note spreads, the tobacco is still really moist and nicely spicy - more steam than I would have expected at 40%.",,,

The peat is a little less oily. We also find the notes of spray, the same citrus with, as noted by Kell, a different scale, a little more bitter orange and a little less lemon, which gives the impression that the 2004 is cooler than this 2005, which seems heavier, more heady. A slightly sulphured note (rubber) reinforces this impression. A small preference in 2004 for the nose.","Boom in your head !! The 2006 had seemed powerful, but I did well to drink before this monster! What a flood of peat, citrus, licorice, gentian, pepper, cinchona, salt, wax!

Perfectly matching is the adour of damp cloth and diesel.","In the mouth, this whisky is soft, oily, and gentle. No harshness whatsoever. It's friendly character is demonstrated by less smoke and more vinous characteristics. This means: prune, old leather books, fig, liquorice, Seville orange.

In the background are sherrylastige wine flavors.  After some time, the herbs come through stronger again, this time with honey and cherry. And now - after twenty minutes - comes a delicate, barely noticeable trail of smoke. With spice it is more smoked cheese than real smoke. Dry pipe tobacco. Modriges leather. Then still peach. Unbelievably interesting. Enchantingly aromatic.","Very sweet, but immediately accompanied by tingling, oak. Tobacco, orange concentrate, resin, fermented fruit, woody honey, a rollercoaster ride. After swallowing, a nice bitterness slowly sets in, leaving enough room for the intense fruits and the sweet spice composition. The Nachschmecken is dominated by tobacco and baked apple.

The peat and the jams have some collisions as if they were fighting for the upper hand. Still quite 'nervous' and surprising until now.After some minutes there are more candied orange peels and hints of tart jams. Clear gooseberries now - with or without peat.Clear oak and salted and peppered cherries. Even some sea air with some 'peatwood'.Finally some settling is happening and sweet/spicy (pepper) raisins appear and very tart honey mixed into some alcohol (maybe (sparkling) wine or even something stronger).The peat doesn't 'cut' other aromas now and the quite wonderful spice mixtures can be now experienced coated by lemon juice and some oranges. Some upholstery and more and more dark chocolate from minute to minute. More interwoven now.Some barley from time to time, tart hazelnut cream, honey poured over cherries, spicy wood, hints of rum and honey cake.Not elegant, more rough and tart (maybe even rude at the beginning) and the HP character shows itself more on the spicy side.Later even some burnt caramel and hints of latte macchiato.Many spices such as mustard seeds and hints of cumin, etc.Unusual nose.","Orange peels, pepper, wood, cherry juice and sweet cherry jam at the beginning.Then there come the old Sherry casks with something really 'old' such as scouring powder with an old cloth and some moving resin.Very dark chocolate, spiciness and tart leather.A lot of citrus and a lot of fire - really intense!Later some gooseberries again and tart fruit sweetnes.Peat and then spicy honey - getting sweet in a slow pace.Espresso powder, plum puree in a chocolate coat.Bread with dark jam.Charcoal and some bark, dark cognac and brandy beans.Finally there is the 'clear' HP character not only from the spiciness but overall!Nice oiliness.Dark and voluminous.","Sherry casks with peat and a lot of spiciness.Tartness with orange peels and spice mixtures.

penumbra,402,93.0,"Yuanwen is the iconic sweet tropical fruit flavor of the refilled sherry bucket, high sugar, high viscosity, dense and strong, specifically manifested as banana peel, Elizabeth melon, sugar orange, butter-roasted banana, and a flickering cucumber With avocado. Compared with the high vintage of the Huage family, the flavor extracted from the barrel is obviously much thicker. Of course, his own oily wine body is also indispensable in shaping this smell. There is a faint floral fragrance on the side, but it is dense The fruity taste suppressed. A closer look at the peat began to emerge. Unlike Lagavulin, Ardbeg's peat sherry, it gives a cold and cold feeling. It is similar to oil spilled sampan, kerosene, and sea salt. It is easy to cause a large piece of sea on the sea in winter. Large-scale crude oil-like associations, or that peat in this wine is not even a polyphonic foil, is just an occasional decorative sound. What can stand against the fruit style is Genting's iconic greasiness, original soda crackers, closets that have been infested with the aroma of fried butter, almonds, coconut milk, honeycomb, cheddar cheese, milk flakes, vanilla, and minerals.","Coconut, white magnolia, Cantonese-style lily pot, ginkgo, barley almond porridge, egg white whipped cream, ok, now we know what the smell of the smell is suppressed by the wind of the fruit, and the peat is almost not involved The degree disappeared, leaving only a negligible amount of smoke. At the same time, there are also fruits different from the smell, similar to bellflower, citrus, yellow peach, lotus mist, mint, vanilla. As for sea salt, fat, sesame, resin, beeswax, chalky soil, soda crackers, coconut jelly, there is almost no change from the smell stage.  It has to be said that the expectation of being greatly raised in the stage of smelling incense, when it comes to the body, is still back to refilling Shirley's formula.","Medium, slightly salty, slightly bitter, essential oil, peach peel, orange stalk, rosin, mint, roasted vanilla.",,,

As for how the big cat produced to replace Karl Rila in 1972 would choose, it is only equivalent to kitten + peat. ? Pouring the wine and smelling the fragrance, the surging bright gold, the clear ocean tune under the warm color filter, and the wine heads that have not been washed for years can capture the reflection on the latecomers, but the MMA gold medals in the past are obviously more than that. The first smell of the aroma makes people can't help but think of Tao Qian's famous works, walking along the river and forgetting the distance. Suddenly there is a peach blossom forest, hundreds of steps across the bank, there are no miscellaneous trees in the middle, the grass is delicious, and the fallen flowers are colorful. It is also like the sweet-scented osmanthus cakes of Linggu Temple in Qingming, Bourbon Shirley, fragrant peat and juicy sweet fruits.

This peat burn that comes in late is  immense. It just stands right up and punches the roof of the mouth with this astounding soot blast. Some carbon and bone dry old wood. The constantly repeated descriptor 'oily' is so very accurate here. It's the oil & grease that put everything together in the body. Unlike the oiliness of crappy blends which serves as insulation between you and the whisky's actual taste this just takes control of the entire mouth and distributes the power evenly across the palate, then helps it sink in.

After all, CI is apparently an immortal distillate that can in suitable conditions be aged past all reason, while remaining spry and powerful, so beating it to death with heavy wood that mutes the distillate and masks its change is a bit daft.

hs305,464,88.0,"The colour of the 1974 is deep gold while the 1978 is two shades paler at old gold. The nose of the 1974 is not punchy at all despite its 63,1% abv and offers a classical old Highland profile with honeys, waxes, floral notes and earthy aromas (forest floor with pine needles). it is delicate and balanced and grows stronger upon breathing adding barley sugars and spices. The 1978 is rather shy and closed first (not punchy too at 56,6% abv). After some breathing it opens up nicely and shows a comparable profile to the 1974 with some more sweet fruits and honeys but without the earthy notes. The differences are marginal, so the distillery profile (distilling regime) did not change between 1974 and 1978. To me this is a clear draw.","The 1974's taste is very old-stylish with lots of waxes, resin, oils and later barley sugars, autumn floral notes (haystacks), chalk and spices. All nicely balanced and layered without any flaw or off-note. The taste of the 1978 is of a comparable profile but a little more simple and not that layered. It shows more barley sugars and lacks the floral flavours, chalk and resinous notes. Nonetheless it is very interesting to explore and quaffable, provided you like the old Highland style. I prefer the 1974 on this dimension.","The initial mouthfeel of the 1974 is hot first, than nicely warming and greatly coats all of the mouth without distracting moments. The 1978 arrives smoother on the palate without the initial hot impression and is comparable warming and coating, so another draw here. Both own a finish of medium length where the 1974 adds more sweeter flavours (honeys and shy fruits) without any distracting moments again. The 1978 adds no new impressions and shows no distracting moments either. I clearly like the 1974 better here. Both drams open up nicely on water and get much more approachable on the palate. Actually, I like them both neat and reduced with the 1974 preferable at 48% abv and the 1978 at 43% abv. I suggest to explore these drams neat first and then play a little with water to find the best reduction level that suits you. Both drams are excellent swimmer, for sure.",88,88,87

hs305,568,89.0,"The colour of the 1974 is deep gold while the 1978 is two shades paler at old gold. The nose of the 1974 is not punchy at all despite its 63,1% abv and offers a classical old Highland profile with honeys, waxes, floral notes and earthy aromas (forest floor with pine needles). it is delicate and balanced and grows stronger upon breathing adding barley sugars and spices. The 1978 is rather shy and closed first (not punchy too at 56,6% abv). After some breathing it opens up nicely and shows a comparable profile to the 1974 with some more sweet fruits and honeys but without the earthy notes. The differences are marginal, so the distillery profile (distilling regime) did not change between 1974 and 1978. To me this is a clear draw.","The 1974's taste is very old-stylish with lots of waxes, resin, oils and later barley sugars, autumn floral notes (haystacks), chalk and spices. All nicely balanced and layered without any flaw or off-note. The taste of the 1978 is of a comparable profile but a little more simple and not that layered. It shows more barley sugars and lacks the floral flavours, chalk and resinous notes. Nonetheless it is very interesting to explore and quaffable, provided you like the old Highland style. I prefer the 1974 on this dimension.","The initial mouthfeel of the 1974 is hot first, than nicely warming and greatly coats all of the mouth without distracting moments. The 1978 arrives smoother on the palate without the initial hot impression and is comparable warming and coating, so another draw here. Both own a finish of medium length where the 1974 adds more sweeter flavours (honeys and shy fruits) without any distracting moments again. The 1978 adds no new impressions and shows no distracting moments either. I clearly like the 1974 better here. Both drams open up nicely on water and get much more approachable on the palate. Actually, I like them both neat and reduced with the 1974 preferable at 48% abv and the 1978 at 43% abv. I suggest to explore these drams neat first and then play a little with water to find the best reduction level that suits you. Both drams are excellent swimmer, for sure.",88,90,89

Tropical fruit aromas lie above it, but cannot be defined in more detail. The alcohol pushes moderately, the mouthfeel is oily.

Quickly shifting into a medium-long development of sweet and sour of juicy oranges, tangerines, some lemon. With water the heat in the arrival is gone. In fact, the arrival is gone.

Honeycomb, toffee and chocolate provide rich sweetness, but that’s really only the supporting act for the myriad pronounced woody notes. Leather polish, furniture polish, shoe polish – all of the polish! That’s not to say this is a one tricky pony – far from it – but, it really does display its 25 year of maturation openly. Also in the mix are some aromas of freshly baked pastries and brown sugars, alongside some mustiness (to be expected frankly) like wet soil or musty brick walls. Cask spicing is surprisingly restrained, though still displaying ginger characteristics. There’s some sharpness here, part citrus, part balsamic vinegar. To my taste a stunning nose that I could engage with for hours. But, did I already tell you how woody it is?","Deck polish (I’m running out of solvent analogies now), rich fruit and bitterness. Again, we’re in the same realm as the nose, but there’s more fruitiness here – sweet but heavily reduced stewed berries.

The 2005 is more interesting to explore while the 2007 is (even) more enjoyable - so I go for a draw on this dimension.","The 2005's taste is truly multi-layered with more sweet fruits, honeys, chocolates, coffee, nuts, and and and. Simply adorable and great to chew, no flaw or imbalance here either. The taste of the 2007 shows again loads of different fruits of all kind beside honeys, chocolates, liquorice and a fair amount of spices (peppers, nutmeg, ginger and hints of cinnamon). Again no flaw or imbalance. Water releases some more aromas in both drams and turns their taste smoother and hence even more quaffable. I like them both neat and a little reduced. In the end I prefer the 2005 (a little) over the 2007 because it owns more layers and depth but this might be just my personal preference (others might see this the other way around).","The mouthfeel of the 2005 is warming and very creamy-coating with no distracting moments whatsoever. Its finish is long and more maritime with minor salty notes. No bitter or drying moments, again all flawless. The 2007 arrives a little punchier with some peppery moments on the palate and is nicely coating too. Its finish is even longer than the 2005's and adds some bitter-drying notes of tea and tobacco. Again I prefer the 2005 over the 2007 because of its greater complexity and more enjoyable mouthfeel. But hey, on that level it is all about personal preferences...",93,94,92

The texture of the 7th shows a fat sticky ring at the top of the glass that very slowly transforms into sticky fat tears that very slowly build legs (this is a great oiliness!). The 5th shows many small sticky tears at the top of the glass that slowly consolidate into bigger tears with very slow moving legs (a very good oiliness, too). The nose of the 5th offers an adorable honey-sweet and maritime-peaty profile with lots of different aromas in a superb balance. The 7th is much more shy on the nose on a comparable profile that shows some more floral and fruity aromas. The nose of the 5th gets more shy after a while too, so both are best nosed immediately after opening the bottle. I like the 5th a little better than the 7th.","The 7th offers a rich and unbelievable complex flavours profile that is truly multi-layered. The 5th owns about the same complexity of aromas on the palate and rolls in different waves over my taste buds, too. No flaws or off-notes that I can detect in both drams. I go for a draw. Water is not needed on the 7th as it turns the dram flatter and releases minor drying moments (papers) so I like it best when neat. The 5th improves on some water added and releases more floral-herbal aromas in the nose and some nice chocolatey flavours in the finish, too. This one I like better when reduced to about 46% abv.",The 7th arrives bold and immediately mouth-coating on the palate with some (rather nice) peppery moments. The 5th has a warming and coating mouthfeel too but the texture is a little thinner than that of the 7th. This round takes the 7th. Both have a very long finish with no bitter or drying notes at all. The 5th is quite sweet on honey flavours surrounded by peaty and spicy aromas. The finish of the 7th offers more floral-herbal aromas that nicely join in the overall complex flavours mix that still is greatly balanced and harmonic.

Here the OB is unbeatable and wins with several points ahead...","Bold and mouth-coating arrival on both drams. Here I prefer the mouthfeel of the MoS over the OB as it is slightly more rich.

In the background, a sweet vanilla mascarpone cream complements the ripe fruit perfectly. Much better for my modest taste barely - at least as far as the fragrance is concerned. I use a small lid to Glencairn to repeat the experience over and over again. Every now and then he likes me a little bit better.","Gentle start but not watered down. Many older malts give a very similar impression. Great, velvety-oily mouthfeel. You can clearly see the cleanly incorporated alcohol, which calms me down, as I had feared that Malt could have lost over the decades maybe a little too much in power. But he does not. The fruity enjoyable experience from the nose continues in the mouth. If not with the same overwhelming presence as before. It would have been too nice. But no dram. A great, creamy pear note remains, as does the mango. In addition, a slight oak spiciness, which was naturally unnoticed in the nose, but now reminds of the ripe age of the malts.","For a non-smoker, an exceptionally long finish, in which the fruit, after a short break, turns into grassy impressions and woody notes. Interesting change. No excessive bitterness, no other junk notes. Nice round. Another brief consideration of the alcohol strength. The natural way, so without further addition of water, in the course of decades in alcohol to just above the minimum strength ""reduced"" Legacy V is a prime example that great Geschack long ago not only in combination with excessive alcohol content to please. Cask strength, which develops very slowly to the drinking strength in the way of the maturity, promises mostly great pleasure. So here too.

hs305,848,91.0,"The colour is burnished and the nose offers a powerful sherry-wooden-blackcurrant profile with all three dimensions fighting for dominance but no one wins, luckily. There are adorable OBFs (nail varnish remover) joining in quickly which team up with the sweet fruity aromas in their battle with the sour winey and bitter wooden impressions. I like that! After some breathing the battle calms down and it seems as if the combatants negotiated a ceasefire. Actually, the balance of this nose improves greatly upon oxidation. This is worth some 3-4 points in my book and that is why one should always have patience with drams, the older they are the more they demand. Obviously, I did not wait long enough when I scored this nose much lower several years ago.","The taste is nicely layered starting on the sweet and sour winey notes but the bitter-spicy woods balance this out quickly. The malt takes its time until it shows up but than it delivers an impressive performance. The trademark Bowmore fruits (currants, passion fruits) join the sherry fruits (oranges, plums) to create an adorable fruit salad topped with a spicy sauce of molten barley sugars. The wood injects bitter tannins from time to time to contain the sweetness somewhat and to add different impressions as does the peat. No flaw or off-note and despite some layers may not be balanced the overall impression is that of a harmonic taste.","The initial mouthfeel is quite hot for 51.3% abv but this vanishes quickly and a warming texture covers all of the mouth instead. The finish is long and provides more of an impression of an amalgam of all the different flavours, it is hard to catch single aromas here. I do not find the bitterness I described in my notes from March, 2017 - maybe I was somewhat tired or stressed back then and my taste buds reacted more sensitive to the tannins. Tonight I find the wood very appropriate and without any bitter-astringent moments at all. It dries out a little towards the end but this is fine with such a sherry maturation. There is a minor cardboardy moment at the very end, too. Water is not needed.",92,91,90

Slightly chilling, the smoke stays there, it has something of mint. The chocolaty side of the Sherry comes through. This is not a modern oak and espresso owl. This is Old School, soft and elegant. Grapes and fresh plums. Raisins and this great sweet-sweetie.  With some time, the smoke goes back further. As a sweet-maritime seaweed and herbal mixture, it stays there. Slightly sherry notes are now added. Tree bark. Tart wood flashes briefly (to my horror), luckily it evaporates and makes burned caramel place. Popcorn - sweet and salty. Both. Grapefruit also answers. The wine character is getting stronger. Gradually, smoke, sherry and oak come together to form a harmonious unit.  Water : The unit returns to different components. The smoke is losing. The sweetie hesitates. The fruit takes a step forward, but the oak rushes off. Again slightly acidic wood flashes, again only briefly, and then comes mountain pine. Resin. It settles down again with recurring chocolate in the ""grandiose"" area.","Full sweetie. The mouth is full. Smoke is added immediately, more clearly than in the nose. Tree bark in honey. Smoked orange. Sweet chocolate with pepper and salt. Nutty wine. Licorice. With the swallowing comes seaweed and Isla moss lollipop. Salty, maritime and sweet and bitter to taste.

After some breathing an extremely complex profile enfolds with old port wine, different jams, some bubble-gum and many more. Twenty minutes later very interesting aromas of both natural and machine oils pop up together with honey and nougat notes.","The taste is multi-multi layered on an over-ripe fruit stew first before sour winey flavours turn it into a fruit liquorice setting. After that dark chocolatey and mocha notes pop up and all of a sudden the whole provides the profile of an old delicious carribean rum (you ever tried a Caroni?). I am completely surprised that despite all these rich flavours the whole stays balanced and harmonic - how can that be? After some chewing dozens of spicy and herbal wooden notes arrive and a certain sourdough bread flavour develops over time. Leave it in the glass for more than 20 minutes and all of a sudden it tastes like a grand old champagne cognac (50+years). After that another liquorice attack starts over and ... find out yourself how this thrilling movie ends! Just a little hint: Did you ever taste original Nuremberger lebkuchen? Oooh, I love that!","The whisky arrives bold and thick on the palate and instantly coats the whole of the mouth with an interesting dark chocolatey film, very astonishing! The finish is virtually endless and adds balsamic vinegar and herbal liquor flavours that are again ... flabbergasting! The woods are strong but never too bitter because all the other bold flavours keep them contained. Unfortunately, It gets cardboardy at the very end what I do not like. Some water releases more aromas in the nose and turns the taste smoother and more approachable but it strengthens the bitter-drying wooden notes, too. A further reduction does actually the same so play around with water to find the level that suits you best. I prefer the neat dram, to be honest.",96,93,89

Later some shy fruity (unripe plums and apples) and mossy notes join in and the typical chalky-metal touch which is somehow a PE characteristic. A complex and balanced nose that is very interesting to explore and delicious to sniff - great stuff, indeed! After some breathing it gets dryer on cold smoke and medicinal aromas (plaster, bandages).","The taste is multi-layered on sweet barley sugars first followed by the tarry and rubbery flavours before some fruits step in and finally the hot spices take over (chili, white pepper, ginger). The peat smoke is there all the time and turns the taste more and more dry over time. In a later layer the trademark PE cold copper pops up and stays until the very end of the finish. The sweetness has vanished almost completely now. Water releases waxy and mineral aromas in the nose and turns the taste sweeter-smoother through reducing the dryness and adding some chocolatey flavours. Actually, I like this dram both neat and somewhat reduced to about 46% abv.",The arrival on the palate is charming and instantly coats the whole of the mouth with a fine creamy feeling without any distracting moment. The finish is very long and strenghtens the sweet flavours again which is great. And some maritime notes of salt and seaweed pop up that are delicious.

Then very light smoke, light medicinal note, a bit of lemon oil, fresh hay, more camphor, smoked vanilla, smoked oyster, hot summer tires, smoked herbs and peppers. Surprisingly mineral. Slightly more herbal and flowery after tasting.","Not considering the price, this is a world class dram. It's quite clean and not as complex as other Port Ellens, but the balance is out of this world. Starts off with light medicinal notes, light peat smoke, a very good dose of cane sugar sweetness, lots of barley sugar, alcohol level just right, it's warm and full without biting too hard. A light note of ginger as well. Second chew is just marvellous. Smoke building up more, barley sugar keeps blasting away, more ginger, a bit of black pepper, light toffee notes, vanilla, brine, very light lemon oil.

Macheye,1706,95.0,"Exquisitely rich and expressive, but given the hefty age statement, you’ll not be surprised when I suggest that some substantial resting time (over 30 minutes) is required here. Once fully opened, there’s nothing shy about this nose – wonderful maturity and remarkable aroma development – it’s hauntingly sexy and an experience you’re unlikely to want to end….ever. Pronounced leather, mahogany polish and musty bone dry paper conjure up images of a wood-panelled Victoria library packed to the rafters with ancient leather-bound tomes. The traditional Highland Park profile is still extraordinarily strong here – dried highland grasses, heathery honey and sweet wispy smoke – but everything is richer, deeper and altogether more refined. Orange peels, Peruvian dark chocolate and liquorice merge with luxuriant dark berry fruits, prune juice and dusty aged spices – cinnamon and nutmeg. The level of smoke here is surprising, it’s still a wafting background aroma, packed full of burnt hays, stubbed out cigars and tinder boxes – but it’s much more pronounced that one might expect from 40 years of maturation – this results in a peat that seeming both ancient and refined and yet lively and spry at the same time. Woodiness levels are unsurprisingly high – and yet still somehow restrained – highly polished dark old wood – not a trace of young sappy vanilla and with plenty of beeswax and lacquered furniture. Beautiful, captivating and lingering. I could nose this forever.","Unctuous, slightly oily and with a perfectly judged arrival that delivers a surge of refined flavour with almost no perceptible alcohol despite the 48.3% ABV. Yes, friends, if you’re judging whisky on its ‘smoothness’ this is as smooth as they come. The front palate offers up a stunning balance of mouth-coating burnt sweet heather and cinder toffee, sitting alongside raisins, orange and dried citrus peels. This develops (slowly) into perfectly judged bitterness – from both spices and wood. Cinnamon, nutmeg, a sprinkle of white pepper and then a wave of tanned leather, ancient saddle hides, dusty books, teak oil, mahogany and ebony woods. The development continues into the back palate where sweetness returns to balance the deeper, spicier wood-led flavours – a harvest of juicy, reduced red and black fruit jams and preserves alongside chocolate and burnt honeycomb. Smoke runs throughout, but is most discernible in the back palate – it’s an intriguing and subtle combination of sun-scorched hays, burnt sugars and coastalness. Glorious.","Almost never ending – ever decreasing little lapping waves of chocolate, berries, ancient wood and aromatic spices. It dries superbly without any perceptible tannic influence.",,,

FrankDrebin,1707,90.0,"Delicate, very ripe, flowery-fruity nose. Sherry, what else? I think there was a high refill share from the beginning.

Not intrusive, takes time.","At first mild start, soft but not expressionless. Initial sweetness, delicate fruit cake flavor, but rather the German variant with dried fruit, not the candied fruit from the UK. Let's say a little sweetened fruit cake. A little Christmassy, ​​then spices are increasingly coming into play, which testify to the long barrel storage: mild white pepper, dried ginger, cardamom, allspice, especially towards the end nutmeg. All a bit framed by a white, dry brandy aroma. The spices go over in a nutshell and fill the mouth without overwhelming it.","Long three-component finish: Asbach-Brandy Bean with a light bittersweet aroma.

Apricots and hazelnuts, followed by raisins and pears, slightly tart wood tones warm the palate.

hs305,1707,89.0,"The colour is amber and the nose offers a fine old-style sherry profile that is nicely balanced with the Glenrothes malt aromas and the cask impact. No flaw that I can find and after some breathing it releases more interesting aromas. Most of them are of the old Highland style like waxes, oils and chalk and they perfectly supplement the sweet winey and malty flavours. I suggest to give this dram at least ten minutes, better more. After more than 30 minutes the herbal impressions grow stronger but the nose stays balanced all the time.","The taste is of that adorable old sherry profile too but with significantly more bitter herbal flavours than the nose offered. This turns the taste a little out of balance as the sweet notes cannot match this rather heavier wood impact. Nevertheless, still this is very enjoyable but you have to like some bitter notes. Adding a little water reduces these but it flattens the dram too, unfortunately. I like the neat dram best.","The dram arrives warming and coating on the palate with a minor drying mouthfeel (tannins) that is not distracting.

Totoro,1707,92.0,"Yep, that's old alright. Definitely not swamped by sherry, develops rather on time-tested ex-bourbon wood with perhaps some refill butts thrown into the mix. Softly herbal and vegetal: mosses, ferns, a forest floor after the rain (petrichor), soft spices (caraway, cumin), wax, polish, and restrained but pronounced fruitiness (mango pureee, ripe banana and peach). The wood is perfectly soft and laid back for the stated age. Beyond that, I'd struggle to describe it more distinctly; it's all extremely interwoven and integrated by the time it's spent in the casks. Just a flawless and mellow old nose, what more can you say?","I'd have expected this to be frustratingly soft, but it's actually amazing on the palate. The natural strength can't have been much higher before dilution, I'd wager. Still super dense, thick and compressed, flavor-wise. Speaking only from memory, I find this richer and fuller than, for instance, the Glenglassaugh 30-year-old OB (42% version). Starts with refill-sherry fruitiness, gets then progressively spicier and more wood-driven, but without going over the edge, and ends with a grand finale of oily/waxy goodness that is hard to put into words.

Honey and beeswax show up to the party, followed by their friends of the forest, fern leaves, orchid, mint again, juniper berries - sappy, slightly bitter and refreshing.Post rain, in the morning, dew drops and scents of the forest. Faint oak scents with sherry, apricot, peach, nectarine, coconut, lemon tart once again. Similar profile to a Cragganmore, not a Convalmore IMHO as others have pointed out.Benrinnes like fruity and slightly metallic with herbaceous notes.On the nose, salty and oily profiles similarly to clynelish plus caol ila.","First thing that hits me is not the alcohol but that salty taste that numbs my tongue, it sure is spicy, bloody numb and spicy like eating mala hotpot. Szechuan peppers be messing my tastebuds up right the start.Grassy notes are definitely all around, which brings us to fruit produce of granny smith apples, pink lady apples, Asiatic pear, pomegranate, Japanese melon, lychee, feijoa fruit and something that stands out from the rest; cactus fruit (Prickly Pear).Time is our best friend, not water, give it time to develop and the flavours will expand over oxidation. As long as the ambient temperature in the room is in control and constant, the rate of expansion will be balanced.Fresh whipped cream, fruit tarts, yeast, sourdough bread, shredded rosemary, candied apple, a mixture of other herbaceous plants which I can identify but may take awhile. Hot cross buns, peach strudel topped off with almonds.Salty, very very salty, similar to a Talisker or a Bunnahabhain for the palate.

Cask1988,1798,,"A classic sherried Bunna nose! It’s a powerful and intens, almost candy like nose. Sweet, full, fruity, and that earthy, dirt-like Bunna bottom layer clearly present. It comes in with a burst of red fruits and raisins on top of it, leaving no doubt about it. Grapes, cherries, berries, sweet plumbs, oriental spices and a refined layer of sherried oak. This nose is nothing short of marvelous.",It has a rather silky mouthfeel. It is sweet and sour and salty. Initially it is a wee shy upon arrival but soon it starts filling the palate with a lot of fruity sweetness and a grape-like dryness. Again it’s not particularly short on red fruit influences but also there are Indian like spices which remind me of yellow curry flavors and hot peppery influences. Mid palate I get very clear armagnac like grape influences and dark oak flavors. Sherry cask made out of French oak?? After hand warming the dram a peaty layer appears in a very delicate and pleasant way!,A rather long sweet and pleasant finish. The clear Armagnac-like flavors continue to be present in the finish. It’s an interesting play between red fruits in like grenadine syrup and that typical Armagnac like grape and intense dark oak flavors. After some time and hand warmth the peaty layer continues in the finish. Lovely!,,,

The second sip looks a little more harmonious, and it starts again slowly on the tongue to Bizzeln and burning.

The texture of the 21y shows small tears with medium fast legs while the 25y has bigger and more sticky tears with medium fast legs. Not really a good oiliness on both drams, unfortunately. The 21y offers a nice nosing profile of mainly autumn floral, herbal and spicy wooden aromas that is balanced but not overly complex. Some barley sugary sweet aromas pop up after a while. The nose of the 25y is more complex as it adds fruity and heather honey aromas to the party. Clearly I prefer the 25y on this dimension but to be honest: I had much better HP noses in the past...","The taste of the 21y is very wood driven with spices and herbs in a rather bitter setting. This is too unbalanced for me as the sweet and fruity flavours hide in the background and are hard to detect. The 25y is better on this dimension but again without being truly great (like older batches). Still this is a fine and complex taste with lots of different flavours, for sure. But I cannot score this above 90 points as this would be unfair to many other fine drams. Some water opens up both the nose and taste of the 21y nicely (a two points difference in my score) but it is not recommended with the 25y as this dram flattens out quickly when reduced by water.","The 21y arrives warming and (just a little) coating on the palate with significant astringent moments from heavy tannins and a slight bitterness. This is not my favourite mouthfeel, unfortunately. Luckily the mouthfeel of the 25y is better but still it is not really coating (I expected this from the rather weak oiliness already). At least there are no astringent or unpleasant bitter moments. But where is the trademark great mouthfeel of HP gone these days? The finish of the 21y adds some sweet flavours (sugars) during the medium finish that are highly welcomed because they at least somewhat balance out the drying bitterness.

hs305,2191,95.0,"The colour is russetmuscat and the nose offers this glorious all-fruits profile of mid-sixties Bowmore which simply is adorable. As if I walk across a tropical fruits market with all the stands made of old oak woods. I take a sniff here and there, all the fruits are ripe and juicy so it is hard to decide which one I like the most. This is one of these noses I could sniff forever and I have to push myself to take a first sip...","...which offers almost the same extraordinary profile on the palate. This is a fruit salad mixed out of all the most delicious fruits I can think of (both home-grown and exotic) with a clear dominance of tropical impressions. Forget about bar cocktails, this is the best-stirred cocktail of flavours my taste buds ever enjoyed. And it is well-structured by very appropriate wooden notes which are firm but never dominating. This taste is deeply layered and each layer is peeled off one after the other with maximum pleasure. Beside the fruits and wooden impressions there are waxes and vegetable oils, spices and herbs, earthy and nutty flavours and many more to explore. I wonder how many different flavours and aromas a trained nose can detect within this dram - it must be more than fifty, I guess. Fabulous.","The initial mouthfeel is fantastic with a warming and creamy texture covering all of my mouth within seconds. No bitter or astringent moments at all (after 40 years of maturation, wow!). The finish is virtually endless, even fifteen minutes after I swallowed a sip I still can taste this beautiful profile without any distracting drying impressions. Right at the end, when almost all other flavours have vanished the barley sugars come out of the dark, and they are tasty too. Water is not needed, this dram is perfect as it is.",96,95,95
dutchdrammer,2191,95.0,,,,,,
hs305,2192,97.0,"The colour is auburn (what is very dark for a bourbon cask maturation) and the texture shows many small tears that slowly consolidate and build slow legs. The nose is a miracle in itself: I guess it is easier to tell the fruits that are NOT in there than the other way around. It is fresh and bold and one of the most complex I encountered so far (not just fruits, there are hints of peaty smoke, spices and herbs too).","The taste is truly multi-layered on all these delicious fruits with barley sugars and honeys, spicy wooden notes, fine peaty-smokey flavours and some maritime aromas. You can chew this dram forever and still you will find something new. Water is not needed (it is a sacrilege to dilute this dram)!","The dram arrives very charming in the mouth and instantly coats the whole of it with a creamy and slightly peppery feeling. Despite the 40 years in an oak cask there are no bitter tannins or astringent moments at all. The finish is very long and extends this beautiful taste into eternity. No distracting moments, all is in perfect balance and harmony. Some more spices pop up while all the fruits stay as strong as they were in the first taste. Really adorable!",98,96,97
Jackson05,2192,95.0,"My first thought goes to Tomatin, and not Islay. Extraordinarily fruity. All the fruits. In this order: Pressed mango and mango skin (how it’s slightly sappy), fresh guava juice, lychee jelly cups my Asian friends gave me as a kid, passion fruit concentrate, perfect honeydew. Those are the dominant fruits but oh, there’s so much more. Kiwi, mirabelle, cotton candy grapes... Toss all that with perfect mint. I love mint, and even more in whisky and this just is beautiful harmony of mint and fruit. No peat, at least it’s not here yet. It demands to be compared, so a 73 Speyside (118356) enters the fray, which I’ll tell you is no slouch, but it’s more on honey/mint and cannot touch the tropical aspects. I’m afraid half of this will evaporate up my nose. I’m drinking this in a 1920’s blenders glass and also a glencairn and it needs to be mentioned how helpful the blenders glass is. You get much more out of the nose. It’s 25% more expressive if I had to quantify it. 95/100.","Slightly waxy on arrival, but only slightly. It’s not thin, but it’s also not heavy on the palate. It’s fresh. Unbelievably fresh. Mint is up here with a little resin, keeping the mango at bay before it takes over. The 73 Speyside is waxy, honeyed and fat; while this is quenching and precise. Apples to oranges. Both top notch. The 1976 Tomatin has the same quenching fruits, while not quite as impressive, it’s the closest I’ve come. Seriously even mangoes aren’t as mango-y. 94/100.","To say fruity is just a blatant understatement. Quenching, concentrated tropical fruits. Sharp. So fresh! How is this 40 years old? A crescendo of mango that is frankly embarrassing. A mango lassie, hold the yogurt. So bloody long too. The best three chews of juicy fruit gum. The mango just dominates and that’s more than ok. It grows in the finish for almost a minute and then it hangs around a little less than forever. Only slightly minty now. I really don’t get peat - any. Honestly the closest whisky I’ve had to this is a 1976 Tomatin (84338), but that one doesn’t quite have the depth or harmony. Let’s test that memory, since this sample in itself is a special occasion, the 76 Tomatin enters the party. Yes! We are in the same ballpark! I’ll tell you these are not that dissimilar. No, in fact they are very similar. This was the most astounding display of mango I’ve ever had. Amazing. 97/100.",95,94,97

Upon a fair reduction it opens up nicely but the sulphurous aromas (spent matches and fireworks) grow stronger too.","The taste is that of a slightly sulphur-spoiled modern sherry (sorry Serge, this is not old-style!) but actually it is not bad as the sulphur is somewhat contained by the heavy sherry notes.

hs305,3092,89.0,"Both have a golden colour with the DL being 2-3 shades darker. Typical PE nose on both drams with this slight metallic (coppery) aroma that is the PE trademark. No other whisky got this (at least I have not found one up to today). Very nice mix of sweet barley, peaty and maritime notes with the DL being more peatier and slightly more complex. I give this round to the DL.","The Pe3 owns a broad profile on floral and maritime aromas (beside the peat and maltiness). The DL is more delicate but less powerful too. It takes a while to detect all the flavours there, somehow it is all mingled altogether. An interesting puzzle. Nevertheless I prefer the more powerful Pe3 in this round. With water the DL gets smoother without loosing its power, I like it that way better. The same is true for the Pe3 with the only exception that the slightly bitter notes during the finish get more dominant.","Good mouthfeel on the DL but the Pe3 is much richer and coating. Clear winner here is the Pe3. The Finish is long and very balanced with the DL, not drying at all.

The nose is all about an absolutely adorable old style oloroso sherry profile with all sherry-induced aromas one can think of and a beautiful OBF aroma (glue). The wood is not too heavy neither in the nose nor on the palate.","The taste is multi-layered on old style oloroso flavours, spices, appropriate wooden notes and a chewable fruity-sugary sweetness. Quite complex with no flaw that I can find. Water releases much more aromas in the nose and on the palate without getting bitter (as so many other heavy sherried drams) so actually I like it better when a little reduced (I accept that the power of the dram is reduced, too). But be careful and do not add to much of it - it never gets bitter but it flattens quickly.","The dram arrives instantly coating and nicely warming in the mouth with no distracting moments despite the 44 years of maturation. The finish is long and more spicy (peppers, ginger) what nicely peps up this dram towards the end. A minor drying feeling (papers) at the very end that is not distracting at all.",94,93,92

And many more, find out!",The taste is multi-layered on all these fine flavours of the nose plus an interesting salty-maritime touch that I like. Upon chewing it turns sweeter and the smoke gets colder (drying) while a fine earthiness developing. Later waxes and honeys join in. Water unlocks more aromas in the nose and turns the taste sweeter with more waxy-earthy flavours. I like this dram both neat and reduced to about 46% abv.,The dram arrives warming on the palate and instantly coats the whole of the mouth.

The RM offers a very fine wooden and sweet malty structure with lots of different flavours added.

hs305,3443,90.0,"The colour is russetmuscat and the nose offers a flawless and delicate sherry profile that leaves enough room for the St. Magdalene malt to enfold. It is not too bold and in this respect rather comparable to modern sherried drams (certainly they did not use paxarette on this cask) but compared to most of the modern sherry casks it is much more complex and balanced - no wonder, back in the seventies such casks contained sherry for years and not just weeks like nowadays...","The taste is nicely layered on bitter-sweet sherry flavours with spicy wooden notes and a floral maltiness. It is greatly chewable and I strongly advice to do so to get the full flavours' spectrum presented. Do not swallow if a layer gets too bitter-astringent - the next one will sooth this instantly with creamy and sweet impressions. There are fine oils, green tea, tobacco notes, waxes and many more to discover - so take your time...",The initial mouthfeel is warming and a little coating with a minor astringent moment from the tannins (that is not distracting). The finish is of medium length and adds some tasty but rather shy dark chocolatey flavours. It turns a little drying towards the end but again this is not distracting. Water releases chalky-mineral and leathery aromas in the nose and turns the taste both more spicy and chocolatey. But be careful not to add too much of it because the dram flattens out quickly. I like to nose this whisky neat and prefer to drink it a little reduced to about 45% abv.,90,90,89

I'm really impressed ! The fruitiness lingers, it's getting sweeter and less citrusy with time : pink grapes, pomgrenate, wowee ! A few minutes later it's going on the savoury side of things with Serrano ham, still that leathery touch, still oranges and a French sauce typically served with fish that we call beurre blanc. It's getting more and more resinous and old school. Glorious. Fruity pana cotta. A very, very high-class nose : complex, yet precise and very approachable.","It might be less complex and precise but it's still quite incredible in its bitter-fruity delivery. The first sip was quite discrete but the rest was really great and very direct : passion fruit, still quite old-school and waxy, it's just a bit more woody (within limits) now, rather on citrus skins, blood oranges, old style soap and pinesap, mint.

Ten minutes later the peaty aromas start a comeback.","The taste shows a comparable profile to the nose with bitter-sweet flavours of cold bonfires, tobacco, green tea and fruits (peaches, pears), honeys and toffee-caramel. There is a close to perfection harmony of these components and despite it is not the most complex taste it is very delicious and quaffable. Water releases more bitter peaty aromas both in the nose and on the palate and drive the dram a little out of its perfect balance - hence I like the neat dram best.","The dram arrives a little hot and nicely coating on the palate with a minor peppery feeling that is enjoyable.

After my olfactory cells adapted to this a fruity (trademark Glen Ord) and malty profile appears which enfolds nicely upon breathing. There are lots of additional aromas to detect over time, among them coffee, oily, waxy and autumn floral impressions. This is a very old-stylish nose - complex and full of surprises but no easy-to-identify aromas. It requires both patience and time to unlock its secrets but it is worth the effort.","The taste is very fruity (exotic fruits mainly) and honey-sweet with a lot of other flavours join in over time. It is not really layered but very chewable and I suggest to do so for some time. Nice spices are released (peppers, cloves, mint and more), a tasty bitter tea-ish note and even an impression that reminds me of old cognac. Not too bad!",The dram arrives hot and coating on the palate with some peppery moments. The finish is of medium length and adds more barley sugars which turn it rather simple and less interesting than the taste. Some water makes the nose even more punchy and smoothes / sweetens the taste but the interesting flavour components are (almost) gone now. More water releases waxy-earthy aromas in the nose but flattens the taste - I like the power and profile of the neat dram best.,89,90,88

Lovely nose that can easily entertain you for more than fifteen minutes.","Ka-boom! Very powerful arrival – which is no surprise, of course – with a very waxy note. Lots of menthol, quinine, dried aprictos, mandarin, strawberry again, candy cherries and coconut. Earl Grey tea (which is kinda funny after the coffee on the nose).

Quaker,3627,87.0,"At the first nose we feel that we are at Glen Elgin. The nose is very intense, it has beautiful notes of precious wood and old wood. One is as if transported to a carpenter's shop, or a visit to a castle in the Loire where one breathes the smell of old polished furniture. In fact, the slightly spicy notes perceived are reminiscent of pine sap. Some floral notes also but rather dried flowers. Cherry and blackcurrant.","Attack very sweet, like an impression of drinking velvet. The whisky is strongly marked by the wood of the barrel. This is not unpleasant, far from it but suddenly the complexity is less. The mouth is in the continuity of the nose from the point of view of flavors but slightly removed from a pleasure point of view. A little licorice too.","Long and silky, in the prolongation of the mouth.",,,
DarrenHJA,3630,93.0,"First impression out of the bottle: French buttered toast slobbered with lots of orange marmalade. On the lows of the nose, I get hazelnut wrapped chocolate with crunched up bits of coconut shavings in the mix.On the mid, burnt brown sugar over strawberries then dipped into fresh cream.On the nose itself, drizzle of medium dark chocolate, cinnamon powder, thyme, new oak (odd for 40 years). Somewhat sulfurous, but at a bare minimal.","Old baked ham hock with honey all over the place. Very thick and difficult to palate from the get go, but as time passes it matures well. Charcoal fired stove, whale blubber on a pan with samphire and tamarind juice plus a drizzle of lemon all over. Let it sit, then a chunk of pork belly is added. Salt and pepper to add flavour, brown sugar for extra kicks. Now we are ready to serve.","Intensely long with a rather dry mixture to boot, really dry which comes off as displeasing. However, the flavours make up for the issue on that part. Generally impressed having not enjoyed many sherry, however, this will top my list of several other extremely sherries malts.",93,96,91

Griller76,3681,99.0,"Time-honored sherry of the highest quality, which has been in the wood for a long time and is sweet at the perfect peak of its maturation.  Sweet dried fruit such as dates, plums, figs, raisins, apricots. But as a well-balanced counterweight, a subtle spicy petrol note. The wood is subtly subtle and leaves the sherry to the large orchestral stage.  Some vanilla and violet are also included. One almost thinks that a little subtle carbon dioxide spices the fragrance into the nose.","Despite the maturity, the alcohol still has a little burning power. Comfortable sweetness and chubby alcoholic burning break each other's first way, like two ruffians from a rugby team, who unite in one lane. The alcohol now runs past you, but remains noticeably nearby and you can deal with the more pleasant colossus of the two.  The aroma is heavily balsamic with bitter oriental spices, as if the baker had peppered a fourfold portion of gingerbread spice into it accidentally. Herbs, such as clove and cardamom, dominate above all. But everything is covered with a sweet and balanced forest honey note.  What a powerhouse!  It is followed by very fine and subtle notes of caramel and creme brulee, the scent of confectionery from an old grocery store.","It is long and remains on the tongue a good half an hour later. Sweet, dry spice and a bit of subtle smoke remain on the tongue, wrapped up in chubby fireplace heat.  What a perfect and unmatched drop!",,,

didi1893,3824,89.0,"Intense amber shines in the Premium Snifter, on the glass wall sticks an oily and tough streak. Appearances of baked apple and overripe pear loosen slowly from the glass, a tropical fruit mix ends slightly flowery and grassy. The floral tones are enhanced by minimal caramelised sugar, while fresh eucalyptus and menthol notes are discreetly in the background. Gradually a slight citrus note appears, the trophic fruits become darker and more dignified. Sweetness plays with fruit, the alcohol is beautifully harmoniously integrated, the nose is complex and a little one-dimensional which does not harm this sweet fruit salad.","Mild, sweet and marked by dark yellow fruit flavors, the first sip flows over the tongue and leaves a subtle and pleasantly sharp film on the tongue. Minimal wood sharpness dissolves from white pepper, spicy wood tones end floral and grassy. Minimal tart wood elements mix with old and dried fruit flavor, abrasion of orange and grapefruit peels make for a slightly tart and sourish impact. The second sip is initially relatively mild, lax and one-dimensional, but quickly gains in volume and power. Chubby warmth in combination with a pinch of pepper pulls through the palate, pleasantly prickles sharpness between the tongue and the palate. The salivation is slowly stimulated, the initial fruit flavors turn into a grassy and floral bouquet. The wood tones are tart and dry, the fruit flavors also.","Woody notes and citrus fruits are dry and dry in the air, and eucalyptus and menthol are minimal again. The voluminous and powerful mouthfeel that has shaped the taste is hardly anything in the aftermath, tart wood elements announce the end of the Nachklangs with slightly grassy citrus aromas.",,,

Greenkeeper,3859,86.0,"Spontaneously, it gives the impression that it has to deal with by far the best of all smoky 12-13 year old BenRiach finishings. Heavy smoke, a little less ham, but a bit more medical, so somewhere in the middle between campfire, BBQ and hospital. It will be interesting if you take a lot of time. Then the smoke impression in the brain fades and gives way to a very fine aroma mixture: first, vanilla and slightly burnt sugar, followed by mangoes and other exotic fruits, then cinnamon, star anise, a little coriander and a lot of dust-dry cocoa powder. Great !","At the beginning there is only fat smoke in the mouth, on the tongue the whisky looks fleshier than in the nose. For a few seconds, there is also a slight alcoholic pungency, which, however, quickly gives way to a pleasantly restrained spicy wood. With the fading of spice and pepperiness, it is very slightly oily and a dark spicy colored fruit impression emerges. Not really fruity, not exclusively spicy, but exotic spiciness and sweet fruits closely linked. A little different, but similar to the nose. Approaches to beautiful complexity are already present, but not so pronounced. Still wonderful and really good, especially for the price between 40-45 €. In my eyes, much better than the three other younger Ben Riach smokers with a finish, but I really like Madeira-finishes in general.","The finish is interesting again, because it adds to the aftertaste of the taste impressions relatively strong, but also because of the contrast to the exotic and light sweetness also very distinct oak bitterness. There is already a lot more barrel here than, for example, the comparatively one-dimensional Arumaticus. The oak will not be unpleasant, because the bitterness is well absorbed by the sweetness. It remains the case: the best of finish-smoky 12-13 years. All you could wish for is a continuation at 17, 18 or 19 years a la Solstice, Albariza and Dunder.",,,

The elegant complexity is just fun.","The texture of the Glenmorangie Signet is wonderfully velvety soft and creamy. At the first sip, a slight tingle (ginger) on the tip of the tongue is noticeable. The start is very full-bodied and sweet and spicy.

Milk chocolate, hints of leather, a touch of malt, dark forest honey and mature oak notes complete the aromatic variety. The well-selected alcohol content blends seamlessly into the harmonious overall picture.","Medium to long, sweet and spicy and chocolaty. Dark forest honey, vanilla, oranges, grapefruits and light sherry notes flash again.

hs305,4105,91.0,"The Moon is around 2-3 shades darker than the much longer matured TWA. The Moon has a quite shy nose that is very complex on a lot of different aromas mainly on honey, fruits (oranges, apples) and some very fine peaty notes. The TWA is stronger in the nose due to its higher abv of 51,4% with again honey and fruits (lemon, apples) but almost no peat at all. So it is a comparable profile (no wonder as the stills are still the same) but with a significant difference in the peat levels. Nevertheless both are very nice and I vote for a draw.","The TWA adds to the honeys and fruits some medical notes (eucalyptus, antiseptic) that get a little bitter over time. The Moon stays smooth but with a significantly stronger peaty profile (than in the nose) that is nicely imbedded in the sweet malt sugar and honey base and topped with delicious exotic fruity flavours (a hint of banana besides all the citrus). The Moon takes this round again due to its higher complexity and greater harmony of all the flavours and aromas.","The initial mouthfeel is very bold and instantly coating with the Moon, a little less rich but very creamy with the TWA. The TWA's heavier alcohol level demands its toll on the tongue with some hot moments. But due to its incredible boldness the Moon is the clear winner in this round. The TWA's finish is substantially longer than the Moon's and it adds surprisingly some new flavours to the party, most prominently lemon grass. The Moon simply extends its beautiful mouthfeel into the finish what is great, but too short (for me). So here the TWA is clearly better.",91,92,89

Of course, the delicate, subtle smoke should not be missing here. In addition, more and more fruity-sweet notes of pears, mangoes and apples and lemon notes are added, followed by delicate vanilla, light chocolate, marzipan and complex spice notes such as ground black pepper, a hint of ginger and the famous chili paste. Everything wonderfully framed by the maritime breeze and the now almost imperceptible smoke.","For 54.2%, the Talisker is surprisingly mild on the tongue. But that doesn't mean that fireworks burn in the mouth. A firework of flavors. The smoke is almost gone, rather the chili patch and the sweetness are present, followed by honey notes and a very interesting herbality that was not there in the nose yet. The maritime note recedes somewhat and the saltiness gives way to hints of lemongrass, vanilla, sour apple and after and an increasingly present cargo of spice notes. Very interesting, very complex, very complex and the flow of saliva doesn't seem to end. No light fare that is difficult to put into words.","I would describe the finish as warming and medium length. At the beginning there is still a lot of saliva and the sweet honey notes dominate, followed by the vanilla and the light chocolate. The smoke is barely noticeable. The impressions of the citrus notes are slowly completed before the spicy and herbal notes take over the scepter. There remains a wonderful mouthfeel, in which the sweetness against the spiciness seem to fight for dominance.

hs305,4255,95.0,"The colour is deep copper and the nose offers exactly this adorable mix of peaty, malty, sherried and wooden aromas old Ardbeg are so famous for. Dozens of different impressions float my olfactory cells with none of them trying to be dominant - and most aromas rather belong to the old whisky styles (not wood/cask-driven but spirit/peat-induced). A nose that can be explored for hours and it is a great pleasure to do so. After significant time of breathing (more than 30 minutes) the interesting peaty-medicinal notes grow stronger while the sherry aromas retreat somewhat - but the balance is kept all the time.","The taste is multi-multi layered with an unbelievably rich profile of different flavours and all in perfect harmony. Again, this is not cask-driven like most of the modern drams but the cask did an excellent job in enriching and supporting the maturation of the spirit. This is a must-chewer and I suggest to keep it in the mouth as long as you can resist the reflex to swallow it. It offers new impressions all the time and none of them are disappointing, actually I enjoy every single one very much.","The initial mouthfeel is very satisfying with a warming and creamy texture coating all of the mouth very quickly. No distracting bitter or drying moments neither in the arrival nor during the finish. That is very long and it vanishes in slowly fading waves which focus on different aspects of the taste again. A dram which can be savoured for hours because I need another small sip only for a new kick of long lasting impressions. Great stuff to quaff! Water smooths the dram but like so often the different layers intermingle now so I suggest to explore this dram neat first before experimenting with any reduction. Personally I prefer the neat dram, but it swims very well, too.",95,96,95

Sweetish, but at the same time clearly maritime influences and slightly tart oak notes, despite the young age. Here is almost everything in it, from honey over citrus notes to fresh herbs. Consistent overall picture and far more mature and promising than the pure age would promise.","Very briefly shows the young age then. Not really sprittig or metallic, but with teething problems and a bit out of round. Then unripe (green) fruits, a little caramel and a light smoke. Decisive but after a short time the strong influence of the oak, spicy and salty-dry.

The arrival has some bite to it - sour apples, sour pineapple and tart cloudy cider. It’s all a bit too acerbic for my liking. There is sweetness here from both honey and caramel, but these are fighting against both bitter fruit and some pretty astringent pepperiness from the cask (that said, resting does allow the sweeter flavours more breathing space). Walnuts come across very strongly, with touches of old wood (which belie the 10 year old age statement on the bottle).

Besides this there are nice herbal, spicy and autumn floral aromas as well as medicinal notes (band-aid, iodine tincture) and the smell of a dunnage warehouse that was not opened for weeks. All nicely balanced and a great profile to explore, I like that!","The taste is as complex as is the nose but with more sweet sherry-induced flavours that perfectly balance the peaty and medicinal notes. It is like licking on a leaking sherry butt in a dunnage warehouse on Islay (yes, this is great - I could do this all night long)! It is multi-layered and again, a great profile to explore.","It arrives immediately coating in the mouth without any distracting moment, just bottled at the right time!

hs305,4511,92.0,"The colour of the RED is of jonquiripe corn whereas the GREEN is much darker at burnt umber. Both show a comparable texture of medium tears with slow legs that speed up towards the bottom of the glass. The RED offers an adorable old-stylish bourbon nose that is centered around an autumn floral, fruity and spicy profile with nice honey and sugary aromas. Very delicate and balanced, I like that! The nose of the GREEN is completely old-style sherry driven (oloroso, mostly) with all these adorable sherry-induced aromas you can dream of. No off-note at all (not a single sulphur-atom, I swear!) but all balanced and delicious. The RED was great already but the GREEN is even better - this is sherry maturation at its best...","The RED shows a truly multi-layered taste that I like to chew for minutes. It starts very sweet on barley sugars, then some spices and honeys join before a great flavour of white chocolate pops up (that I adore in this setting). There are many fruity and floral flavours in there too that show up after some time as they are rather subtle and are dominated by the other aromas during the first layers. Not a single off-note that I can detect, fantastic! The taste of the GREEN is multi-layered too with a fine balance of the sherry and malty flavours (despite the very strong sherry influence the Springbank malt characteristics are clearly recognisable). I guess experienced taste buds can identify more than 30 different flavours and aromas in the GREEN. It is chewable for minutes, too and without any flaw (again not a single trace of sulphur!): Because of the additional sherry-induced flavours I prefer the GREEN a little bit over the RED (but the RED is great too, for sure!). Some water releases more aromas both in the nose and on the palate of the RED that is worth a try. Nevertheless I prefer the neat RED, without doubts. Water turns the GREEN smoother and more approachable (quaffable) too, it adds very nice chocolatey notes that in the neat dram just lurk in the background. I prefer a little reduced GREEN over the neat version (but try out yourself)...","The RED arrives warming and nicely coating in the mouth without any distracting moment at all, this is pretty good! The mouthfeel of the GREEN is comparable warming and coating with a minor drying-astringent feeling from heavy tannins (there must be quite old sherry casks in this batch, for sure). This feeling is not annoying at all, it rather promises a great taste to the (experienced) connoisseur. The finish of the RED is long and extends the beautiful tasting experience without any distracting feeling. It adds a pinch of salt and some other spices to this delicate taste. The finish of the GREEN is even longer than the RED with more wooden notes (spices, a little dryness) that are a good contrast to the sweet taste.
