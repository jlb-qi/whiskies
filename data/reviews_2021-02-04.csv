hs305,1,86.0,The colour is amontillad and the texture shows a few slow late legs and late fat tears. The nose is all about a honey-sweet sherry profile with some vanilla-driven aromas. Just as you would expect from the two casks it matured in. I like it when marketing and reality fit together...,"The taste is on honey, vanilla -toffee and some sherry-induced flavours like dark chocolate and raisins. Not the slightest trace of sulphur, so congrats to an excellent cask management at Balvenie. The wood is still a little heavy and bitter but not as extreme as with the first mouthfeel. It is bearable now and after a while even enjoyable.","The dram arrives in the mouth gentle and smooth but with some astringent feelings from heavy tannins that I do not like. Another victim to the cask shortage crisis (some virgin oak in there)? Not too sure about that but it feels this way. The finish is of medium length and gets more chocolatey, really nice. Just a slight dryness from the wood (not unpleasant here).",88,81,85
DulischM,1,76.0,"At the beginning the whisky is sweet on the nose and characterized by vanilla, which changes into aromas of spring-like light honey. At the end there is some nutty, malty sweetness.","In the mouth it is light and pleasantly sweet, vanilla and honey are great in harmony and there is a hint of sherry under everything. The malt sweetness passes over to the aroma of young, but dry wood after a long time.","The finish is sweet with a little honey, malt sweetness remains on the palate. When the whisky has already left the palate, a tiny bit of fresh grass and wood aroma emerges.",,,

Punktar,1,85.0,"Yellow fruits, some sherry and honey. Anyway, in the first nose. After that comes more honey. And some vanilla? Smells very intense and how a good Speysider should smell. For those who liked the old Founders Reserve, it took a bit of getting used to. But I like it so far.","Hmm, soft, fruity and vanilla. Just another sip ... Now with some honey and something like cinnamon in the background? Just another sip! Clearly yellow fruits (and mandarin?) And vanilla. A little bit of alcohol, but that does not really bother. Delicious! One more ... No, I just want to try.","Pretty long and pleasant. Long-lasting fruity tangerine, now more pronounced than before.",,,

vojt466,1,83.0,"Sherry in a symbiosis with citrus fruit, vanilla, dried fruit, nuts, light earthy, and quite a good dose of spice.","Again, sherry tones, raisins, figs, vanilla, fruit compote and fine cinnamon. Very pleasant, however, 40% of alcohol keeps the taste unnecessarily back","In the reverberation from the beginning of the dried fruit, later vanilla, hazelnut and finally dried in combination with a slightly alcoholic tone",,,
